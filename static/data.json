This is where I first encountered HTML and began to delve into the world of web development.\n\nOver the next two years, I focused on mastering HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript as I worked remotely and searched for orders on freelancer websites. By the beginning of 2013, I had secured a large permanent customer from Moscow, with whom I worked exclusively for some time. However, in 2014, I decided to seek out a position in a larger company where I could work alongside more experienced developers and expand my knowledge further.
