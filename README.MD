# CV Project

Hello and welcome to my Frontend CV Site's README. I built this website to showcase my skills, search for new job opportunities, and demonstrate my web development capabilities in a semi-casual tone. The site is designed to be user-friendly and responsive on various devices.

If you somehow desire to use it â€” feel free to start it with
```
npm i
npm run start
```

Just replace some data in data.json, GL&HF

Sincerely,
Alex
