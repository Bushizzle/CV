After graduation, I continued to work as an interior photographer while also beginning to study C++ as I was eager to explore programming. After a few months, I unexpectedly received an opportunity to complete someone else's project - a simple static site for a company dealing with patents. This is where I first encountered HTML and began to delve into the world of web development.\n\nOver the next two years, I focused on mastering HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript as I worked remotely and searched for orders on freelancer websites. By the beginning of 2013, I had secured a large permanent customer from Moscow, with whom I worked exclusively for some time. However, in 2014, I decided to seek out a position in a larger company where I could work alongside more experienced developers and expand my knowledge further. Despite the challenges and setbacks that inevitably arise in any field, I remained committed to my passion for programming, constantly striving to improve my skills and deliver the best possible results.",
